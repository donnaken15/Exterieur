GRACE
Trip, when are you going to get rid of this?

TRIP
What, Grace... this?

GRACE
Yes, you know how I feel about it --

TRIP
I know I know I'll do it right now, alright?!

GRACE
You know I've had to ask you about this several --

TRIP
Get off my back!  I'll get rid of it in just a minute!

GRACE
Fine, Trip... fine...

(Trip opens the front door.)

TRIP
Trip!! 

TRIP
Hey!  I thought I heard someone out here! Great to see you!  It's been a while, how's it going?

GRACE
No, no, here we are!

GRACE
Trip, 

GRACE
Hi!  How are you?  God it's been a while!

TRIP
hi

GRACE
H-mmm (happy smile sound)

GRACE
And, I've got to say, you look really good!

GRACE
Well, come on in, make yourself at home! -- (interrupted)

TRIP
thanks

GRACE
Aw, ha ha ha!

TRIP
Heh heh,    Trip,  seeing you brings back good memories, you know?

(Trip closes the front door.)

GRACE
Yes, it does.   H-mmm (happy smile sound)

TRIP
Hey, I just realized something.

GRACE
What...

TRIP
Oh, tonight's a special night!  A celebration in fact!

GRACE
What do you mean?

TRIP
Trip,  remember, it was almost exactly ten years ago, tonight, that you introduced us. 

TRIP
Senior year of college!

GRACE
Oh... geez...

TRIP
Remember that?

TRIP
yes

TRIP
We really want to thank you for years and years of...

GRACE
Pain.

TRIP
Heh heh heh... Agony.

GRACE
Love.

TRIP
Uh, yeah, love, yeah, love.

GRACE
Well... it didn't take long for you two to...  bond, or whatever...

TRIP
Oh,    Adam,  I thought you might like this photo I just put up from our recent trip to Italy.

GRACE
  Might like it?  It's a beautiful picture of the Italian countryside, of course he'll like it!

GRACE
By the way, anybody, join me on the couch if you like.

TRIP
Um...  now,,    Adam,  what does this picture make you think of?

GRACE
  Think of?  Ha ha.  That's easy. -- (interrupted)

TRIP
romance

TRIP
  Right!  Love!  Romance!

TRIP
Uh!  Everything in Italy was so romantic... the scenery, the food, the wine... 

TRIP
 oh, and the art!  The art!  Isn't that right Grace?

GRACE
That's right, Trip.

TRIP
(little sigh)

TRIP
Ah,    Adam,  you probably didn't come here to hear this, heh...

GRACE
What?

GRACE
Trip, there's nothing wrong with disagreeing in front of our friend --

TRIP
Disagreeing?!  We're NOT disagreeing.  

TRIP
We're not.  

GRACE
You know, ever since we got married, Trip is forever trying to get me to buy new furniture, and redecorate, 

GRACE
and -- and it's true, I kind of enjoy it but...

TRIP
Well, yeah, it's great, everybody loves it when they come in and see our latest decoration scheme!

GRACE
But,    Adam,  you have to look at this room, and admit it looks terrible.

TRIP
Grace --

GRACE
I mean, look around, this room is... it's hideous!

TRIP
Grace, no, no, don't say that!

GRACE
You know at work I waste all day designing ads for apartments like this, 

GRACE
and then it makes me think, I want this style for my apartment...

TRIP
This style make me feel like I'm inside one of your ads, it's great!

GRACE
but... dammit, I'm wrong, it is just not coming together at all!

TRIP
Not coming together... what?

GRACE
(frustrated sigh)

TRIP
Grace, everything's fine!  No one is complaining about your decorating --

GRACE
No, decorating is just -- 

GRACE
(frustrated sigh)

GRACE
There must be some way I could --

TRIP
Grace, listen to me, people like your decorating, you're the only one who feels this way!

GRACE
  I don't know what to think. I don't know.

TRIP
You're good at decorating, trust yourself.

TRIP
Ah,    Adam,  what we really need here... 

TRIP
are some drinks!

GRACE
Oh, is that what we need...

TRIP
When it comes to drinking, I have the simplest tastes.   I'm uh always satisfied with the best.

TRIP
This is great... For us I'm going to open an amazing, I mean, exquisite Bordeaux.  

TRIP
Adam,  you've not said a single word for a while now... Are you alright? -- (interrupted)

TRIP
I'm ok

TRIP
So... I'm going to open an exquisite Bordeaux...

GRACE
God Trip, you're just like my dad with the whole wine snob thing.

TRIP
I'll take that as a compliment.     Adam,  what do you say?

TRIP
ok

TRIP
Excellent!  You've got good taste.

GRACE
No no, 

GRACE
Adam,  maybe you'd like some juice, or a mineral water?

TRIP
Oh come on...

TRIP
ok ill have orange juice

TRIP
Yeah, no, we need to open this wine!  Our friend is here, we're going to enjoy ourselves, that's all there is to it!

GRACE
(frustrated sigh)

TRIP
I've been dying to try this Bordeaux for a long time, this is the perfect opportunity --

TRIP
alright then

GRACE
That's not our anniversary wine is it?

TRIP
ooooo

GRACE
That's not the Bordeaux we saved from our wedding, that we were going to drink on our tenth wedding anniversary, RIGHT?!

TRIP
Whoops.

TRIP
Ahh, this is bullshit!

GRACE
Ahh, no, you're full of shit!

GRACE
Our anniversary wine!

GRACE
Sometimes I feel like our whole marriage is just for show!  I don't know what you really feel!

TRIP
(little impatient sigh)     Adam,  can you believe this?

TRIP
(frustrated sigh)

GRACE
Oh,    Adam,  yeah...

GRACE
I can predict what you'll say...

GRACE
You've been critical of me all evening!

TRIP
what??

TRIP
What?  What -- what are you saying to me?  What?

GRACE
Our anniversary wine!

GRACE
You so desperately want to be high class!  So badly!

TRIP
Oh, come on...!

TRIP
i've said none of that

GRACE
Uhh, can you -- can you just... -- (interrupted)

GRACE
Alright, you know what,     Adam, 

TRIP
just what

GRACE
I'm going to ask you something.

TRIP
Grace --

GRACE
Trip, let me ask our guest a question.

GRACE
Adam,  yes or no...

GRACE
In a marriage, shouldn't one person try to make their spouse a better person, even if they don't want it?

TRIP
no

TRIP
What? -- (interrupted)

GRACE
What...?!

GRACE
Oh, yes, that's fine... that's fine...

GRACE
Don't you see, Trip?!  Our marriage... is a sham, Trip!  Don't you see that?  It's all fake, all pretend...

TRIP
Oh, Jesus...!

TRIP
Yeah, go on, get out of my face! 

TRIP
I can't stand frigging looking at you!

TRIP
Goddammit, Grace!

TRIP
uhh!

TRIP
Adam,  I can't believe this is happening...!

TRIP
uhh...

TRIP
Look, if -- if you want to go, just...

TRIP
Oh, Jesus... Christ...

GRACE
What? If you're talking to me, I can't hear you!

TRIP
I'm not!

GRACE
Adam,  (annoyed sigh) Trip can just be so...

TRIP
Oh, we're talking about me, are we?

GRACE
What?

GRACE
Damn it, Trip, you and my parents are always planning these stupid trips I have to go on..

TRIP
They're vacations! Expensive ones at that!

GRACE
Of course nobody thinks to ask me what I want. 

TRIP
Oh, now it's all my fault. Just because your parents and I get along, now it's some big conspiracy.  

GRACE
God... 

TRIP
Look, let's not focus on just me or you, let's talk about us both.

GRACE
I think Trip's afraid of visiting his parents. He does everything he can to avoid seeing them.

TRIP
Afraid of my parents?! My parents are idiots. 

GRACE
No, it's true...

TRIP
Let's keep talking about us both, not just one of us.

GRACE
Adam,  you -- you blame me for all this, don't you?

TRIP
no

TRIP
See, I don't think you really want to be an artist.   -- (interrupted)

GRACE
No?

GRACE
Oh, thank God you disagree, that really helps us!

TRIP
you're the one saying i critized you

TRIP
but i didn't

TRIP
Grace, even though you're now a creative director at work, 

TRIP
 the truth is... you're not an artist.

GRACE
Uhh...!

TRIP
I'm sorry, you're not.

GRACE
Adam,  uhh...

GRACE
Adam,  you see, this is what I've had to put up with, for ten goddamn years.

TRIP
Look, I think we should focus on Grace.

TRIP
Adam,  you think this is all my fault, don't you?

GRACE
See, you lied to me when you said I'd be able to take time off from work at some point, to start painting again.

TRIP
I never said such a thing, you're completely making that up!

TRIP
    

TRIP
Adam,  do you agree with that crap?     -- (interrupted)

TRIP
no

GRACE
No?

TRIP
Thank you, saying that might just help her understand!

TRIP
 Anyhow, it's true -- if you really wanted to paint art, which I don't think you do, 

TRIP
 you could do it on the weekends, instead of obsessively redecorating our apartment.

GRACE
Uhh...

TRIP
i didn't critize her but she thinks i

TRIP
Look, let's talk about us both, not just one of us.

TRIP
You know what makes me so angry?  

(TRIP sits on the couch.)

GRACE
What?

TRIP
How you've so conveniently forgotten how much you used to actually hate painting!

GRACE
Adam,  I -- I -- uhh...!

GRACE
Let's keep the focus on us, our relationship.

TRIP
You know, I can't say Grace never acts loving towards me...

TRIP
Adam,  She's all over me at our goddamn parties, trying to look good in front of the guests!

GRACE
Adam,  it's time that Trip finally just admits that our marriage --

TRIP
Grace, don't, no, you don't need to --

GRACE
Admits that our marriage is not --

TRIP
Stop it, stop it!     (annoyed sigh)

GRACE
Uhh...! God...!

TRIP
can you not complain

GRACE
Uhh, this painting, well... mmm...  see, all I really wanted was something personal and, uh... beautiful and special...

TRIP
Grace... 

GRACE
But I just... mmm... no, I -- I just get so depressed and angry when I look at it!

TRIP
Jesus...! 

TRIP
No, look, there's nothing wrong with the stupid painting! 

GRACE
Well it makes me feel like shit.

TRIP
Uhh... you feel that for no reason! 

GRACE
Look, let's not focus on just me or you, let's talk about us.

TRIP
It's so annoying... Grace, why is it that anytime I want to do something nice for you, you resist it?

GRACE
Trip...

TRIP
  Like I always have to convince you?

GRACE
Adam,  you know, we... uhh...

TRIP
Let's talk some more about us both.

TRIP
You know, Grace, ever since I first proposed to you, almost ten years ago now...

GRACE
Trip...

TRIP
it's always been impossible to get you to just... just... feel happy...!

GRACE
Adam,  Trip, I... we... uhh...

GRACE
Okay, stop, I -- I can't do this anymore, goddammit!

GRACE
Adam,  I know what you're hinting at...

GRACE
about us... 

GRACE
about art... 

GRACE
Do you really want the honest truth? Huh?

TRIP
yes

GRACE
Adam,  do you want that? 

GRACE
Trip, huh?

TRIP
Yes...!

GRACE
Adam,  say something!

GRACE
Adam,  I've actually been paying close attention to what you've been saying tonight.

GRACE
You've really been pushing me.

GRACE
It makes me wonder if you're really my friend...?

TRIP
Grace!

GRACE
Adam,  I've got to ask you -- yes or no...

GRACE
Do you really think that...

GRACE
and what you said about trying to make your spouse better... 

GRACE
and you don't even say 'yes' when I ask you if you want the truth...

GRACE
that we're supposed to now understand something about ourselves from all that?

GRACE
Is all of that arguing intended to mean something, or...

TRIP
no

GRACE
No?  Oh, well... I'm surprised you say that, I thought it did. 

GRACE
Trip, I --

GRACE
I let you stop me from being an artist.

TRIP
You let me --

GRACE
I was afraid, Trip okay?

GRACE
I -- I admit it.

GRACE
I didn't know if -- if I could do it, be a real artist...

GRACE
And I've been using you as an excuse for why I didn't do it.

GRACE
uhh...

TRIP
uhh...

TRIP
Jesus...!

TRIP
Adam,  I --

TRIP
What?!

TRIP
This changes everything...

GRACE
Yes, it does change everything.

GRACE
I think it's over.

TRIP
Grace, w -- what --

GRACE
No!!

GRACE
It's over, Trip, don't you see that?

TRIP
Wha... but you just said --

GRACE
I just told you something about us I should have said a long time ago:

GRACE
I've been using you as an excuse to not be an artist...

TRIP
Grace, no, I... y -- you...

GRACE
No, Trip, this isn't about you, or me, it's about us... 

GRACE
 Our marriage.  I see that now.

TRIP
Me...? uh...  Our marriage...?  Hey, no, wait!

GRACE
Adam,  I'm sorry.  But thank you, you -- you really helped us.

TRIP
Grace!

(Grace opens the front door.)

(Grace closes the front door.)

TRIP
Grace!!

TRIP
Jesus Christ...

(TRIP gets up from the couch.)

TRIP
I should have told her that...

TRIP
she's stupid whatever

TRIP
I -- I could have told her that...
